# 📝 Notes Management API – Scalable RESTful API with Authentication, Search, Pagination, and CI/CD

A production-ready **RESTful Notes API** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **PostgreSQL**, with a focus on clean architecture, test-driven development, DevOps best practices, and performance optimization.

This project simulates a real-world backend system with full CRUD operations, JWT-based user authentication, protected routes, rate-limiting, search functionality, pagination, and CI/CD integration using GitHub Actions. It is containerized using Docker and deployed on **AWS EC2** for scalability and availability.
